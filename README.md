# AzureRange
Generates Complementary Subnets of Azure Datacenter IP Ranges. Live site is at http://iprange.omartin2010.com

#Current Features
>- Creating a list of prefixes to advertise to Azure to mimic forced tunneling by excluding a set of IPs that are already accessible directly from inside the Microsoft Azure Cloud.
>- Selecting the regions of your choice to generate the custom list
>- Ability to choose which format (CSV, CIDR or prefix/mask, or IOS or ASA configuration samples).

#Future Plans
>- Ability to add custom IP prefixes for the customer to exclude specific ranges from the forced tunelling approach. For example, you might have an PaaS service or other web service that isn't part of Azure but for which you would still want Azure VNet resources to access that service without hairpinning back on premise. 
>- Ability to generate ACLs for specific devices (Cisco IOS/IOS-XE, ASA, and more - but we need help there :) - Juniper, etc.) to create  traffic fiters that would only allow the prefixes for regions (in the case of datacenters) or services (in the case of Office 365)  IN THE CLOUD to be routed. That's the opposite list of what's currently being generated and they would be applied to two different set of interfaces as it is the case with the Azure Public Peering and the Microsoft Peering ;
>- Open to all kind of great ideas around the management of IP/hostname inside Azure services
>- Possibility for a user to login in the app, using AAD credentials, enabling user-specific behaviors and reminders
	>- Ability for a user to monitor (and be notified when there's a change on) a specific set of hostname for IP changes (for cloud services).
